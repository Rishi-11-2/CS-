GoodAfternoon Sir/Mam, Hello My name is Rishi Chowdhury , and I'm a Computer Science And Engineering graduate from NIT Durgapur. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong interest in Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as Machine Learning. I am a specialist on codeforces and 4* on codechef and actively give  contests on these coding platforms. I also worked as a
research intern under DR. Sujoy Saha from NIT Durgapur during which I developed a 3D CNN model and a LSTM model for classifying the 8 hand gestures. My most recent internship was with Samsung where I developed a python script to analyze Perfetto trace files for identifying the potential bottlenecks in performance


Questions:

explain the workflow of your project ,(code base) 
run the code and show the website
why  chose cisco?


What tech stack you used in your project and the reason behind it?

used node.js because it has chess.js and chessboard.js library which can be used to render the chessboard on the screen and chess.js for implementing the chess logic  for checking whether a valid move was made or not, for checking checkmate, draw or stalemate

Problems faced while making your project and how you solved it?
Like i find it difficult to implement the server side logic when a player joins a room which has already another player in it, routing the player to the specific room route which they joined

Are you planning any upgradation in your project?

now the players are joining the another room by manually entering the room code . in the future I intend to use a shareable link which a player can share with the another player so that this player can join the room of the first player
